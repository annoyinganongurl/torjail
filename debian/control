Description: more secure way to force programs to exclusively use Tor network
 Simple command line utility that easily creates a separated network namespace
 (using ip netns) with its own network interface and a link to the host
 interface with some iptables rules (on host) that force traffic generated from
 inside torjail to only exit via Tor (including DNS).
